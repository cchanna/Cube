# SDL-tetris
I'm testing out the SDL libraries by making a simple tetris clone.

## How to build
Make sure you have Visual Studio's C++ developer tools installed, navigate to the code directory, and run **build.bat**. 
It's that easy! No promises it'll actually work on your machine, since this is just me messing around.
