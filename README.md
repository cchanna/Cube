# SDL-tetris
I'm testing out the SDL libraries by making a simple tetris clone.

## How to build
Make sure you have Visual Studio's C++ developer tools and SDL 2.0.4 installed
somewhere, then navigate to the code directory. Edit **build.bat** to point SDLPath to the appropriate directory on your machine, then run the script. 
It's that easy! No promises it'll actually work on your machine, since this is just me messing around.
